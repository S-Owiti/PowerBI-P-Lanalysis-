## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze the performance and player behavior in an online casino using Power BI. By leveraging the capabilities of Power BI, we aim to provide meaningful insights into revenue trends, player activity, and game popularity, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions to improve business outcomes.

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on the following data sources:
- **Players Table**: Contains demographic information about the bets or stakes placed by the players.
  - Columns: FiscalYear, MonthEnding, Wagers, PromotionalCouponsorCreditWagered, CancelledWagers
- **Revenue Table**: Records each detailed financial information that summarizes the revenue generated by the Casino.

  - Columns: FiscalYear, MonthEnding, OnlineCasinoGamingWin/Loss, PatronWinnings, TotalGrossGamingRevenue
- **Deductions Table**:  This table lists all the financial liabilities and deductions that need to be subtracted from the gross revenue to calculate the net revenue.
  - Columns: FiscalYear, MonthEnding, Payment(5), PromotionalDeduction

## Data Model

The data model consists of relationships between the tables to enable comprehensive analysis:
- **Players (1) to Revenue (M)**: Linked by `FiscalYear`
- **Players (1) to Deductions (M)**: Linked by `MonthEnding`
- **Revenue (1) to Deductions (M)**: Linked by `MonthEnding`

## Key Metrics

Key metrics calculated and analyzed in this project include:
- **Total Revenue**: The sum of all amounts bet by players.
  - `TotalRevenue = SUM(Transactions[TotalGrossGamingRevenue])`
- **Total Payout**: The sum of all amounts won by players.
  - `TotalPayout = SUM(Transactions[OnloneCasinoGamingWin/Loss])`
- **Net Revenue**: Total revenue minus total payouts.
  - `NetRevenue = SUM(Transactions[TotalGrossGamingRevenue]) - SUM(Transactions[Payment(5)])`

## Insights and Visualizations

The analysis yielded several insights, presented through various visualizations:

1. **Revenue Trends**:
   - A line chart showing net revenue over time to identify trends and seasonality.
   - Filters for different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly).

2. **Player Activity**:
   - A bar chart displaying the revenue earned by players over time.
   - A heatmap showing peak activity hours.

3. **Deductions Trends**:
   - A gauge representing the distribution of  various expenses and costs incurred by the casino in the course of its operations.

## Conclusion

This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of online casino gaming data, highlighting key metrics and insights into player behavior and revenue generation. The visualizations and metrics offer valuable information for stakeholders to make informed decisions, optimize game offerings, and enhance player engagement.

By continuously updating the data and refining the analyses, the casino can stay ahead of trends, improve its marketing strategies, and increase overall profitability.
